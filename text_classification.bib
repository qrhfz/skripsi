	abstract = {Hoax newsthat contain incorrect (false) information often become public consumption on social media today. This hoax phenomenon raises doubts about information and makes confusion in the community. In this study, experiments conducted aimed at selecting the best algorithm in classifying hoax and non-hoax news with the number of data in 251 articles in Indonesian language (100 hoax articles and 151 non-hoax articles) using text mining method and machine learning based approaches. This research undergoes the text preprocessing phase which consists of tokenizing, case folding, filtering, stopwords removing, stemming and TF-IDF weighting using unigram and bigram combine features before processing it into classification text. The results of this research is the Random Forest algorithm that gets the best accuracy in classifying hoax and non-hoax news compared to the Multilayer Perceptron algorithm, Naïve Bayes, Support Vector Machine, and Decision Tree with an accuracy value of 76.47\%.},

	abstract = {Currently, the spread of hoax news has increased significantly, especially on social media networks. Hoax news is very dangerous and can provoke readers. So, this requires special handling. This research proposed a hoax news detection system using searching, snippet and cosine similarity methods to classify hoax news. This method is proposed because the searching method does not require training data, so it is practical to use and always up to date. In addition, one of the drawbacks of the existing approaches is they are not equipped with a sentiment analysis feature. In our system, sentiment analysis is carried out after hoax news is detected. The goal is to extract the true hidden sentiment inside hoax whether positive sentiment or negative sentiment. In the process of sentiment analysis, the Naïve Bayes (NB) method was used which was optimized using the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) method. Based on the results of experiment on 30 hoax news samples that are widely spread on social media networks, the average of hoax news detection reaches 77\% of accuracy, where each news is correctly identified as a hoax in the range between 66\% and 91\% of accuracy. In addition, the proposed sentiment analysis method proved to has a better performance than the previous analysis sentiment method.},

But printed medias also often include hoax news in their published news. In the present era, it is very important providing information with relevant and additional facts otherwise it is categorized as hoax. Therefore, hoax classification approach is needed. This paper focuses on improving the accuracy of hoax classification in textual documents contents. Naive Bayes algorithm is used to train dataset with the use of PSO in the algorithm. Experiment is conducted with the trained model over 600 documents. It shows that feature selection with PSO affects the classification results performed using Naïve Bayes. Accuracy increased from 91.17\% without using feature selection, to 92.33\% when feature selection is carried out using PSO.},

	abstract = {A deliberate falsehood intentionally fabricated to appear as the truth, or often called as hoax (hocus to trick) has been increasing at an alarming rate. This situation may cause restlessness/anxiety and panic in society. Even though hoaxes have no effect on threats, however, new perceptions can be spread that they can affect both the social and political conditions. Imagery blown from hoaxes can bring negative effects and intervene state policies that may decrease the economy. An early detection on hoaxes helps the Government to reduce and even eliminate the spread. There are some system that filter hoaxes based on title and also from voting processes from searching processes in a search engine. This research develops Indonesian hoax filter based on text vector representation based on Term Frequency and Document Frequency as well as classification techniques. There are several classification techniques and for this research, Support Vector Machine and Stochastic Gradient Descent are chosen. Support Vector Machine divides a word vector using linear function and Stochastic Gradient Descent divides a word vector using nonlinear function. SVM and SGD are chosen because the characteristic of text classification includes multidimensional matrixes. Each word in news articles can be modeled as feature and with Linear SVC and SGD, the feature of word vector can be reduced into two dimensions and can be separated using linear and non-linear lines. The highest accuracy obtained from SGD classifier using modified-huber is 86\% over 100 hoax and 100 nonhoax websites which are randomly chosen outside dataset which are used in the training process.},

In 2016, the election for US president has been held, due to this event, there are several fake news spread through social media. This incident has to take responsibility for the huge effect on the election result. Therefore, a method for detecting hoax should be developed to prevent the impact of the hoax. The purpose of this research is evaluating several machine learning methods for detecting fake news. The dataset that uses in this research is hoax news collected from Department Communication and Information of Central Java Province (November 20018 and December 2018) and www.turnbackhoax.id (December 2018 until March 2019). The number of documents used for this research is 150 documents consist of 75 documents with true category and 75 documents hoax category. Feature extraction used in this research is TF-IDF algorithm. This research evaluates the performance of several machine learning methods such as MNB, k-NN, Logistic classification, and LSVM in classifying fake news. Base on the test result using 10-fold validation, Logistic classification have the best accuracy with 84.67\%.},

Nowadays, various news content is not only easy to obtain but also easy to produce through various platforms on the internet, including popular online media, such as blogs and websites. So a lot of news content on blogs and websites that are currently being circulated leads to fake news content (hoaxes) that can mislead the perception and thoughts of the readers. Therefore, it is important to develop a system that can detect the presence of fake news content to minimize the losses caused by the presence of fake news content. In this study, the Naive Bayes algorithm is proposed as a machine learning model that will be used to detect fake news content in Indonesian language online media. As a result, the global accuracy value reached 71\% with recall, precision, and F1-Score values as a whole above 70\% which indicates that the proposed model can detect fake news content quite well.},

	abstract = {Social media for news consumption is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, its low cost, easy access, and rapid dissemination of information lead people to seek out and consume news from social media. On the other hand, it enables the wide spread of “fake news”, i.e., low quality news with intentionally false information. The extensive spread of fake news has the potential for extremely negative impacts on individuals and society. Therefore, fake news detection on social media has recently become an emerging research that is attracting tremendous attention. Fake news detection on social media presents unique characteristics and challenges that make existing detection algorithms from traditional news media ineﬀective or not applicable. First, fake news is intentionally written to mislead readers to believe false information, which makes it diﬃcult and nontrivial to detect based on news content; therefore, we need to include auxiliary information, such as user social engagements on social media, to help make a determination. Second, exploiting this auxiliary information is challenging in and of itself as users’ social engagements with fake news produce data that is big, incomplete, unstructured, and noisy. Because the issue of fake news detection on social media is both challenging and relevant, we conducted this survey to further facilitate research on the problem. In this survey, we present a comprehensive review of detecting fake news on social media, including fake news characterizations on psychology and social theories, existing algorithms from a data mining perspective, evaluation metrics and representative datasets. We also discuss related research areas, open problems, and future research directions for fake news detection on social media.},
