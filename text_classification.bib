The main objective of this application is to build a vehicle monitoring system for school children. Nowadays, parents are perturbed about children going to school because of the increasing number of cases of missing students. On certain occasions, students need to wait a much longer time for arrival of their school bus; our proposed system provides a technical solution for the above scenario. The system consists of an Internet enabled android application which will interact with a server. Authentication, attendance monitoring, vehicle tracking are the other features provided by the system. Driver, Faculty/Teachers, Parents, and Administrators are the end users of the application. The application uses wireless technologies like GPS and GPRS/GSM. With this android application parents can watch all the movements of the bus and monitor their child’s presence.},

	abstract = {The application of information technology in the field of navigation in public transportation and the popularity of the Android operating system on mobile devices led to a variety of mobile app that is aiming to facilitate users in navigating with their desired mode of transportation. Google Maps application, which is provided by Android-based mobile devices, is currently able to provide information and navigation on city’s public transit although its availability is still limited to certain areas or towns. Its limitation brings up mobile device navigation applications to be built by local developers to provide information and navigation in using public transport in such area. When people are navigating on a public transit by using mobile application, they may experience difficulties in operating their mobile devices or are not allowed to use their smartphone during the trip. Finding stops or interchanges to take or how long they have to stay on the line before they have to get off or switch to another line becomes more difficult. This research proposed a design and evaluated a new input interaction method that utilizes Android Wear-based wearable devices in implementing an intuitive local public transport navigation system to overcome the problems. The proposed system is expected to provide step-bystep assistance in public transport navigation by utilizing Android Wear-based wearable devices such as an Android smartwatch and its embedded sensors. Experimental results show that the interface simplification of a step-by-step directions mobile application into a wearable device is feasible for future implementation, but they may have different usability level compared to a traditional mobile map application.},

	abstract = {Nowadays the number of cars with empty seats travelling a long distance are increasing on the roads. By bringing people, who are travelling to the same destination, in a single car can decrease the number of vehicles on the road and thereby reduce the pollution to a large extent. Web and mobile applications for carpooling are very common now which provide basic features like sharing of journey, user rating etc. However, all these applications could not provide efficient location tracking. In this paper, we propose an efficient mobile application for carpooling with some unique features like user location tracking and traffic anomaly detection. The location tracking is included as a security feature which enables the user to share his or her current location with their near and dear ones. Anomaly detection feature can reduce the unnecessary wastage of time during the journey by analyzing the pre reported traffic anomalies like processions, accidents, road works etc. reported by others and redirecting the vehicle through another best route. But there is a chance for false anomaly reporting possible. In order to make this feature foolproof, we propose a truth estimation technique using recursive EM algorithm in this paper. Recursive EM algorithm is an efficient streaming algorithm generally implemented in social sensing application as it can solve the estimation problem on a real time basis. This android based application consist of a user friendly interface through which user can create and manage trips, track location, report an anomaly, etc. Location tracking is implemented using Google Map API by collecting the GPS data from each client and feeding it into the database in real time.},

Although Android Baidu map provides basic map data, the services for Guilin tourism are still limited. To solve this problem, a travel assistant application (APP) for Guilin based on Android Baidu Map and Java language is designed and developed. The APP uses SQLite Embedded Database to store tourism information, and uses Android Baidu Map SDK package to obtain the data in Baidu Map database as tourism map information, which will be loaded into the APP for interface display. The design of request permission, SQLite database, APP page layout and specific functions are carried out for the App. Combined with the Service1, Service2 and Service3 of Android Baidu Map SDK, the APP specific functions such as map display, map positioning, geocoding, Point of Interest (POI) retrieval, route planning, navigation and route POI information are implemented to help users obtain more convenient and quick tourism information services.},

	abstract = {Money transaction through ATM machine wherever we go has become phenomenon in our day-to-days activities as it is safe to keep a ATM card rather than keeping cash. When we need cash in any unknown area or during any emergency situation, we need to know about nearest ATM booth from where we can avail this opportunity. In addition, a tourist or new comer may face difficulty in having ATM help without this information. Hence, we have proposed a location based ATM locator system (LBALS) using OpenStreetMap, a growing open source digital map where ATM booths and fast tracks are mapped. Database contains detail information about all available ATM booths and fast tracks of different banks. It requires GPS supported android device with application installed on it for the user. Textual information are provided of nearest ATM booths or fast tracks from user’s current position when he requires the information. Some Markers indicate ATM booths or fast tracks on the map. Dijkstra’s algorithm has been applied to show the possible shortest path between user and an ATM booth. Haversine formula is also used to calculate perpendicular distance. Implemented LBALS is tested for some random locations in a specific region of our country.},

This work presents CheckDroid, a tool towards automatically detecting bad patterns early in the development cycle. Its originality relies on the idea of mapping bad practices into appropriate paths in the code which can be found by static taint analysis. The main beneﬁt for developers consists in the ability to early, simply and quickly clean up the code of potential causes of runtime errors. More speciﬁc tools can be used later for deeper veriﬁcation. Preliminary experimental evaluation shows that CheckDroid is able to ﬁnd common bad practices incurred in by newbie Android programmers.},

When farmers have used quality seeds, improved on-farm handling and advanced harvesting technology, the researchers began to focus on post-harvest problems. In Indonesia, the potatoes post-harvest loss is high at 32.8 kg/ton. Transportation and distribution problems have an effect of 20.43\%. The contribution of this research is an Android-based advanced navigation system based on navigation radius for the route guidance system (RGS). We used the Dijkstra algorithm which we combined with latitude and longitude-based dynamic maps using Google APIs server for determining the shortest potatoes distribution route. To optimize the distance of the navigation radius, we used the radians approach on dynamic coordinates. The route that we calculated was all the nodes that were in the navigation radius. We can display distribution centers (DC) at a certain radius with the Google Maps fragment activity that embedded into the application and navigate to that place. So this method made it easy for decision makers to distribute their potatoes via the shortest route. The RGS using an android-based navigation that we proposed was implemented on a mobile application, and a comparison with the classical Dijkstra algorithm was performed. The results showed that this navigation system was better, more reliable with an accuracy rate of 99.83\%. This proved that the android-based navigation system that we developed can be used.

	abstract = {Money transaction through ATM machine wherever we go has become phenomenon in our day-to-days activities as it is safe to keep a ATM card rather than keeping cash. When we need cash in any unknown area or during any emergency situation, we need to know about nearest ATM booth from where we can avail this opportunity. In addition, a tourist or new comer may face difficulty in having ATM help without this information. Hence, we have proposed a location based ATM locator system (LBALS) using OpenStreetMap, a growing open source digital map where ATM booths and fast tracks are mapped. Database contains detail information about all available ATM booths and fast tracks of different banks. It requires GPS supported android device with application installed on it for the user. Textual information are provided of nearest ATM booths or fast tracks from user’s current position when he requires the information. Some Markers indicate ATM booths or fast tracks on the map. Dijkstra’s algorithm has been applied to show the possible shortest path between user and an ATM booth. Haversine formula is also used to calculate perpendicular distance. Implemented LBALS is tested for some random locations in a specific region of our country.},

This work presents CheckDroid, a tool towards automatically detecting bad patterns early in the development cycle. Its originality relies on the idea of mapping bad practices into appropriate paths in the code which can be found by static taint analysis. The main beneﬁt for developers consists in the ability to early, simply and quickly clean up the code of potential causes of runtime errors. More speciﬁc tools can be used later for deeper veriﬁcation. Preliminary experimental evaluation shows that CheckDroid is able to ﬁnd common bad practices incurred in by newbie Android programmers.},

This would allow to inform the drivers not only about the current shortest paths to destination but also about alternative, timely computed paths to avoid being trapped in the trafﬁc jams signaled by cyber-physical-social systems. To this aim, the paper proposes a set of algorithms that solve very fast the All Pair Shortest Paths problem in both the free ﬂow and congested trafﬁc regimes, for road networks of medium-large size, thus enabling location-based systems to deal with emergencies and critical trafﬁc conditions in city and metropolitan areas, whose transport networks typically range from some hundreds to many thousands of nodes, respectively. The paths to avoid being trapped in the trafﬁc jams are computed by using a simulation of the shockwave propagation, instead of historical data. A parallel version of the algorithms is also proposed to solve the All Pair Shortest Paths problem for metropolitan areas with very large road networks. A time performance analysis of the proposed algorithms for transport networks of various size is carried out.},

	abstract = {A* is a search algorithm that has long been used in the pathfinding research community. Its efficiency, simplicity, and modularity are often highlighted as its strengths compared to other tools. Due to its ubiquity and widespread usage, A* has become a common option for researchers attempting to solve pathfinding problems. However, the sheer amount of research done on the topic makes it difficult to know where to start looking. With this paper, we hope to create an accessible, up to date reference on the current state of the A* search algorithm for future pathfinding projects to consider. This paper examines A-Star's current usage in the field of pathfinding, comparing A* to other search algorithms. It also analyzes potential future developments for AStar's development. A* cannot keep up with the demands of current pathfinding problems. Other algorithms can maintain the same performance while also demanding less overhead and this problem only grows worse as grid size increases. However, use of innovative modifications such as different heuristic types or secondary components to the algorithm allow A* to achieve very fast times with good accuracy when dealing with large maps, while only having slightly increased overhead costs for the modifications. While beginning to show its age, improved algorithms based on the classic A* algorithm are more than capable of keeping up with modern pathfinding demands. These derivative search algorithms such as HPA* is used to overcome the limitations of A*. HPA* can compete with and even surpass its competitors depending on the challenge faced.},

The reason for finding the shortest route is to summarize the journey and save on travel costs. Effectiveness of a search algorithm in finding a route or destination depends on the process or steps provided by the algorithm itself so that certain algorithms are suitable for searching the shortest route. In finding an effective and efficient route, it is necessary to apply an appropriate search algorithm so that the suggested route will really be the best. This study will focus on two applications of the route search algorithm, namely the A* algorithm and Dijkstra's algorithm.

	abstract = {Nowadays the number of cars with empty seats travelling a long distance are increasing on the roads. By bringing people, who are travelling to the same destination, in a single car can decrease the number of vehicles on the road and thereby reduce the pollution to a large extent. Web and mobile applications for carpooling are very common now which provide basic features like sharing of journey, user rating etc. However, all these applications could not provide efficient location tracking. In this paper, we propose an efficient mobile application for carpooling with some unique features like user location tracking and traffic anomaly detection. The location tracking is included as a security feature which enables the user to share his or her current location with their near and dear ones. Anomaly detection feature can reduce the unnecessary wastage of time during the journey by analyzing the pre reported traffic anomalies like processions, accidents, road works etc. reported by others and redirecting the vehicle through another best route. But there is a chance for false anomaly reporting possible. In order to make this feature foolproof, we propose a truth estimation technique using recursive EM algorithm in this paper. Recursive EM algorithm is an efficient streaming algorithm generally implemented in social sensing application as it can solve the estimation problem on a real time basis. This android based application consist of a user friendly interface through which user can create and manage trips, track location, report an anomaly, etc. Location tracking is implemented using Google Map API by collecting the GPS data from each client and feeding it into the database in real time.},

	abstract = {The application of information technology in the field of navigation in public transportation and the popularity of the Android operating system on mobile devices led to a variety of mobile app that is aiming to facilitate users in navigating with their desired mode of transportation. Google Maps application, which is provided by Android-based mobile devices, is currently able to provide information and navigation on city’s public transit although its availability is still limited to certain areas or towns. Its limitation brings up mobile device navigation applications to be built by local developers to provide information and navigation in using public transport in such area. When people are navigating on a public transit by using mobile application, they may experience difficulties in operating their mobile devices or are not allowed to use their smartphone during the trip. Finding stops or interchanges to take or how long they have to stay on the line before they have to get off or switch to another line becomes more difficult. This research proposed a design and evaluated a new input interaction method that utilizes Android Wear-based wearable devices in implementing an intuitive local public transport navigation system to overcome the problems. The proposed system is expected to provide step-bystep assistance in public transport navigation by utilizing Android Wear-based wearable devices such as an Android smartwatch and its embedded sensors. Experimental results show that the interface simplification of a step-by-step directions mobile application into a wearable device is feasible for future implementation, but they may have different usability level compared to a traditional mobile map application.},

	abstract = {As one form of the greedy algorithm, Dijkstra's can handle the shortest path search with optimum result in longer search time. Dijkstra's is contrary to A-Star, a best-first search algorithm, which can handle the shortest path search with a faster time but not always optimum. By looking at the advantages and disadvantages of Dijkstra's and A-Star, this tutorial discusses the implementation of the two algorithms in finding the shortest path in routes selection between 24 SPBU (gas stations). The routes are located in Medan City and represented in a directed graph. Moreover, the authors compare Dijkstra's and A-star based on the complexity of Big-Theta (Θ) and running time. The results show that the shortest path search between SPBU can be solved with Dijkstra's and A-Star, where in some cases, the routes produced by the two algorithms are different so that the total distance generated is also different. In this case, the running time of A-Star is proven to be faster than Dijkstra's, and it is following A-Star principle which selects the location point based on the best heuristic value while Dijkstra's does not. For the complexity, Dijkstra's is Θ(n2) and A-Star is Θ(m*n), where 0 ≤ m ≤ n.},

	abstract = {In path planning there are several methods that can be used. The methods that can be used for path planning are the Breadth First Search (BFS) algorithm and the A* algorithm. The method used depends on the environmental conditions. Path planning testing in various environments using different methods can determine the performance of each method.. So the purpose of this study is to compare the BFS algorithm with the A* algorithm in doing path planning. The comparison process was carried out in five test environments. The test environment used is without obstacles, obstacle traps, simple obstacles, maze obstacles and narrow obstacles. Comparison of the BFS algorithm and the A* algorithm based on the execution time and the number of nodes required to perform path planning. The results show that the path search from the starting point to the destination point can be completed using the BFS and A* algorithms. Both the BFS and A* algorithms produce the same path costs. The difference occurs in the nodes required by the BFS and A* algorithms to generate a path from the starting point to the destination point. The BFS algorithm requires more nodes than A* to reach the destination point. The difference in the number of nodes makes the execution time different. The execution time of the BFS algorithm takes longer than A*. Based on the tests that have been carried out, the A* algorithm is faster in planning paths. But in the maze test environment there is a slight time difference. On BFS it takes the fastest time of 4.09 seconds and on A* it takes the fastest time of 3.88 seconds. And in the maze environment, there are quite a few differences in the number of nodes, namely 26 nodes. This proves that A* is not always far superior to BFS.},

The topic which is discussed in Twitter is important information that we need to know. The information can be used to improve the performance of Surabaya Government services. Twitter data is a text data that consists of thousands of variables. Text mining is frequently used to analyze this kind of data, including topic modeling and sentiment analysis. This study would work on topic modeling focused on the algorithm employing Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA). The evaluation of the algorithm performance uses the topic coherence. As unstructured data, the Twitter data need preprocessing before the analysis. The stages of preprocessing include cleansing, stemming, and stop words. The advantages of LSA are fast and easy to implement. LSA, on the other hand, doesn’t consider the relationship between documents in the corpus, while LDA does. This study shows that LDA gives a better result than LSA.},

	abstract = {Topic models have been widely utilized in Topic Detection and Tracking tasks, which aim to detect, track, and describe topics from a stream of broadcast news reports. However, most existing topic models neglect semantic or syntactic information and lack readable topic descriptions. To exploit semantic and syntactic information, Language Models (LMs) have been applied in many supervised NLP tasks. However, there are still no extensions of LMs for unsupervised topic clustering. Moreover, it is difﬁcult to employ general LMs (e.g., BERT) to produce readable topic summaries due to the mismatch between the pretraining method and the summarization task. In this paper, noticing the similarity between content and summary, ﬁrst we propose a Language Model-based Topic Model (LMTM) for Topic Clustering by using an LM to generate a deep contextualized word representation. Then, a new method of training a Topic Summarization Model is introduced, where it is not only able to produce brief topic summaries but also used as an LM in LMTM for topic clustering. Empirical evaluations of two different datasets show that the proposed LMTM method achieves better performance over four baselines for JC, FMI, precision, recall and F1-score. Additionally, the generated readable and reasonable summaries also validate the rationality of our model components.},

It is challenging to handle the sparsity and the noise problems confronting short texts. Some approaches employ latent topic models, based on global word co-occurrence, to obtain topic distribution as the representation. Others leverage word embeddings, which consider local conditional dependencies, to map a document as a summation vector of them. Unlike the existing works which explore the strategy of utilizing one to help the other, i.e., topic models for word embeddings or vice versa, we propose CME-DMM, a collaboratively modeling and embedding framework for capturing coherent latent topics from short texts. CME-DMM incorporates topic and word embeddings through the attention mechanism and implants them into the latent topic models, which signiﬁcantly improve the quality of latent topics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CME-DMM could perceive more coherent topics than other popular methods, resulting in a better performance in downstream NLP tasks such as classiﬁcation. Besides the interpretable latent topics, the corresponding topic embeddings can describe the meanings of latent topics in the semantic space. The attention vectors, as a by-product of the learning process, can identify the keywords in noisy short texts.},

	abstract = {Topic modeling is a widely studied foundational and interesting problem in the text mining domains. Conventional topic models based on word co-occurrences infer the hidden semantic structure from a corpus of documents. However, due to the limited length of short text, data sparsity impedes the inference process of conventional topic models and causes unsatisfactory results on short texts. In fact, each short text usually contains a limited number of topics, and understanding semantic content of short text needs to the relevant background knowledge. Inspired by the observed information, we propose a regularized non-negative matrix factorization topic model for short texts, named TRNMF. The proposed model leverages pre-trained distributional vector representation of words to overcome the data sparsity problem of short texts. Meanwhile, the method employs the clustering mechanism under document-totopic distributions during the topic inference by using Gibbs Sampling Dirichlet Multinomial Mixture model. TRNMF integrates successfully both word co-occurrence regularization and sentence similarity regularization into topic modeling for short texts. Through extensive experiments on constructed real-world short text corpus, experimental results show that TRNMF can achieve better results than the state-of-the-art methods in term of topic coherence measure and text classiﬁcation task.},

	abstract = {Currently, the spread of hoax news has increased significantly, especially on social media networks. Hoax news is very dangerous and can provoke readers. So, this requires special handling. This research proposed a hoax news detection system using searching, snippet and cosine similarity methods to classify hoax news. This method is proposed because the searching method does not require training data, so it is practical to use and always up to date. In addition, one of the drawbacks of the existing approaches is they are not equipped with a sentiment analysis feature. In our system, sentiment analysis is carried out after hoax news is detected. The goal is to extract the true hidden sentiment inside hoax whether positive sentiment or negative sentiment. In the process of sentiment analysis, the Naïve Bayes (NB) method was used which was optimized using the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) method. Based on the results of experiment on 30 hoax news samples that are widely spread on social media networks, the average of hoax news detection reaches 77\% of accuracy, where each news is correctly identified as a hoax in the range between 66\% and 91\% of accuracy. In addition, the proposed sentiment analysis method proved to has a better performance than the previous analysis sentiment method.},

But printed medias also often include hoax news in their published news. In the present era, it is very important providing information with relevant and additional facts otherwise it is categorized as hoax. Therefore, hoax classification approach is needed. This paper focuses on improving the accuracy of hoax classification in textual documents contents. Naive Bayes algorithm is used to train dataset with the use of PSO in the algorithm. Experiment is conducted with the trained model over 600 documents. It shows that feature selection with PSO affects the classification results performed using Naïve Bayes. Accuracy increased from 91.17\% without using feature selection, to 92.33\% when feature selection is carried out using PSO.},

This situation may cause restlessness/anxiety and panic in society. Even though hoaxes have no effect on threats, however, new perceptions can be spread that they can affect both the social and political conditions. Imagery blown from hoaxes can bring negative effects and intervene state policies that may decrease the economy. An early detection on hoaxes helps the Government to reduce and even eliminate the spread. There are some system that filter hoaxes based on title and also from voting processes from searching processes in a search engine. This research develops Indonesian hoax filter based on text vector representation based on Term Frequency and Document Frequency as well as classification techniques. There are several classification techniques and for this research, Support Vector Machine and Stochastic Gradient Descent are chosen. Support Vector Machine divides a word vector using linear function and Stochastic Gradient Descent divides a word vector using nonlinear function. SVM and SGD are chosen because the characteristic of text classification includes multidimensional matrixes. Each word in news articles can be modeled as feature and with Linear SVC and SGD, the feature of word vector can be reduced into two dimensions and can be separated using linear and non-linear lines. The highest accuracy obtained from SGD classifier using modified-huber is 86\% over 100 hoax and 100 nonhoax websites which are randomly chosen outside dataset which are used in the training process.},

Nowadays, various news content is not only easy to obtain but also easy to produce through various platforms on the internet, including popular online media, such as blogs and websites. So a lot of news content on blogs and websites that are currently being circulated leads to fake news content (hoaxes) that can mislead the perception and thoughts of the readers. Therefore, it is important to develop a system that can detect the presence of fake news content to minimize the losses caused by the presence of fake news content. In this study, the Naive Bayes algorithm is proposed as a machine learning model that will be used to detect fake news content in Indonesian language online media. As a result, the global accuracy value reached 71\% with recall, precision, and F1-Score values as a whole above 70\% which indicates that the proposed model can detect fake news content quite well.},

	abstract = {Social media for news consumption is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, its low cost, easy access, and rapid dissemination of information lead people to seek out and consume news from social media. On the other hand, it enables the wide spread of “fake news”, i.e., low quality news with intentionally false information. The extensive spread of fake news has the potential for extremely negative impacts on individuals and society. Therefore, fake news detection on social media has recently become an emerging research that is attracting tremendous attention. Fake news detection on social media presents unique characteristics and challenges that make existing detection algorithms from traditional news media ineﬀective or not applicable. First, fake news is intentionally written to mislead readers to believe false information, which makes it diﬃcult and nontrivial to detect based on news content; therefore, we need to include auxiliary information, such as user social engagements on social media, to help make a determination. Second, exploiting this auxiliary information is challenging in and of itself as users’ social engagements with fake news produce data that is big, incomplete, unstructured, and noisy. Because the issue of fake news detection on social media is both challenging and relevant, we conducted this survey to further facilitate research on the problem. In this survey, we present a comprehensive review of detecting fake news on social media, including fake news characterizations on psychology and social theories, existing algorithms from a data mining perspective, evaluation metrics and representative datasets. We also discuss related research areas, open problems, and future research directions for fake news detection on social media.},

This paper focuses on the latter definition in order to identify news clickbaits that are published in Twitter. The aim of this work is to use recent Transfer Learning models to detect news clickbaits by adding various configuration changes to the existing models. Based on the author’s knowledge, this is the first attempt to adapt Transfer Learning to classify Clickbaits in social media. In this work we fine-tuned BERT, XLNet and RoBERTa models by integrating novel configuration changes into their default architectures such as model expansion, pruning and data augmentation strategies. Webis Clickbait dataset was used to train these models and the best performed model at the Webit Clickbait competition 2017 was considered as our benchmark. The analyses in this work are mainly focused on eight different scenarios after applying several fine-tuning approaches and model configuration changes to the default Transfer Learning models. The results shown that, our modified Transfer Learning approaches outperformed the considered benchmark. In our experiments, the best performed Transfer Learning model was RoBERTa with the integration of an additional non-linear layer with the hidden output tensor. this configuration has achieved 19.12\% more accuracy in compared to the benchmark model for the binary classification. There is no significant performance improvement when each model expanded by adding an extra RNN layer(s). Apart from that, we experimented with another labelled clickbait dataset (Kaggle clickbait challenge) to explore the performance of our fine-tuned models under different scenarios.},

	abstract = {Social media is a popular medium for the dissemination of real-time news all over the world. Easy and quick information proliferation is one of the reasons for its popularity. An extensive number of users with different age groups, gender, and societal beliefs are engaged in social media websites. Despite these favorable aspects, a significant disadvantage comes in the form of fake news, as people usually read and share information without caring about its genuineness. Therefore, it is imperative to research methods for the authentication of news. To address this issue, this article proposes a two-phase benchmark model named WELFake based on word embedding (WE) over linguistic features for fake news detection using machine learning classification. The first phase preprocesses the data set and validates the veracity of news content by using linguistic features. The second phase merges the linguistic feature sets with WE and applies voting classification. To validate its approach, this article also carefully designs a novel WELFake data set with approximately 72 000 articles, which incorporates different data sets to generate an unbiased classification output. Experimental results show that the WELFake model categorizes the news in real and fake with a 96.73\% which improves the overall accuracy by 1.31\% compared to bidirectional encoder representations from transformer (BERT) and 4.25\% compared to convolutional neural network (CNN) models. Our frequency-based and focused analyzing writing patterns model outperforms predictive-based related works implemented using the Word2vec WE method by up to 1.73\%.},

	abstract = {The availability of social media, blogs, and websites to everyone creates a lot of problems. False news is a critical issue that can affect individuals or entire countries. Fake news can be created and shared all over the world. The 2016 presidential election in the United States illustrates that problem. As a result, controlling social media is essential. Machine learning algorithms help to detect fake news automatically. This article proposes a framework for detecting fake news based on feature extraction and feature selection algorithms and a set of voting classiﬁers. The proposed system distinguishes fake news from real news. First, we preprocessed the data taking unnecessary characters and numbers and reducing the words in the dictionary (lemmatization). Second, we extracted some important features by using two types of feature extraction, the term frequency-inverse document frequency technique and the document to vector algorithm, a word embedding technique. Third, the extracted characteristics were reduced with the help of the chi-square algorithm and the analysis of the variance algorithm. We used three data sets that are published online: Fake-or-Real-News, Media-Eval, and ISOT. We used ﬁve performance metrics to evaluate the proposed framework: accuracy, the area under the curve, precision, recall, and f1-score. Our system achieved 94.6\% of accuracy for the Fake-or-Real dataset. For the Media-Eval dataset, the system achieved 92.3\% of accuracy. For the ISOT dataset, the system achieved 100\% of accuracy. We contrast the proposed framework with several other classiﬁcation algorithms. The experimental results show that the proposed framework outperforms the existing works in terms of accuracy by 0.2\% for the ISOT dataset.},

	abstract = {In the present era, social media platforms such as Facebook, WhatsApp, Twitter, and Telegram are signiﬁcant sources of information distribution, and people believe it without knowing their origin and genuineness. Social media has fascinated people worldwide in spreading fake news due to its easy availability, cost-effectiveness, and ease of information sharing. Fake news can be generated to mislead the community for personal or commercial gains. It can also be used for other personal beneﬁts such as defaming eminent personalities, amendment of government policies, etc. Thus, to mitigate the awful consequences of fake news, several research types have been conducted for its detection with high accuracy to prevent its fatal outcome. Motivated by the aforementioned concerns, we present a comprehensive survey of the existing fake news identiﬁcation techniques in this paper. Then, we select Machine Learning (ML) models such as Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM), Passive Aggressive Algorithm, Random Forest (RF), and Naive Bayes (NB) and train them to detect fake news articles on the self-aggregated dataset. Later, we implemented these models by hyper tuning various parameters such as smoothing, drop out factor, and batch size, which has shown promising results in accuracy and other evaluation metrics such as F1-score, recall, precision, and Area under the ROC Curve (AUC) score. The model is trained on 6335 news articles, with LSTM showing the highest accuracy of 92.34\% in predicting fake news and NB were showing the highest recall. Based on these results, we propose a hybrid fake news detection technique using NB and LSTM. At last, challenges and open issues along with future research directions are discussed to facilitate the research in this domain further.},

	abstract = {In COVID-19 related infodemic, social media becomes a medium for wrongdoers to spread rumors, fake news, hoaxes, conspiracies, astroturf memes, clickbait, satire, smear campaigns, and other forms of deception. It puts a tremendous strain on society by damaging reputation, public trust, freedom of expression, journalism, justice, truth, and democracy. Therefore, it is of paramount importance to detect and contain unreliable information. Multiple techniques have been proposed to detect fake news propagation in tweets based on tweets content, propagation on the network of users, and the profile of the news generators. Generating human-like content allows deceiving content-based methods. Network-based methods rely on the complete graph to detect fake news, resulting in late detection. User profile-based techniques are effective for bots or fake accounts detection. However, they are not suited to detect fake news from original accounts. To deal with the shortcomings in existing methods, we introduce a source-based method focusing on the news propagators’ community, including posters and re-tweeters to detect such contents. Propagators are connected using follower-following relations. A feature set combining the connectivity patterns of news propagators with their profile features is used in a machine learning framework to perform binary classification of tweets. Complex network measures and user profile features are also examined separately. We perform an extensive comparative analysis of the proposed methodology on a real-world COVID-19 dataset, exploiting various machine learning and deep learning models at the community and node levels. Results show that hybrid features perform better than network features and user features alone. Further optimization demonstrates that Ensemble’s boosting model CATBoost and deep learning model RNN are the most effective, with an AUC score of 98\%. Furthermore, preliminary results show that the proposed solution can also handle fake news in the political and entertainment domain using a small training set.},

	abstract = {Recently, there is a rapid and wide increase in fake news, defined as provably incorrect information spread with the goal of fraud. The spread of this type of misinformation is a severe danger to social cohesiveness and well-being since it increases political polarisation and people’s distrust of their leaders. Thus, fake news is a phenomenon that is having a significant impact on our social lives, particularly in politics. This paper proposes novel approaches based on Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) for the fake news detection system to address this phenomenon. The main aim of this paper is to find the optimal model that obtains high accuracy performance. Therefore, we propose an optimized Convolutional Neural Network model to detect fake news (OPCNN-FAKE). We compare the performance of the OPCNN-FAKE with Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and The six regular ML techniques: Decision Tree (DT), logistic Regression (LR), K Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Naive Bayes (NB) using four fake news benchmark datasets. Grid search and hyperopt optimization techniques have been used to optimize the parameters of ML and DL, respectively. In addition, N-gram and Term Frequency—Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) have been used to extract features from the benchmark datasets for regular ML, while Glove word embedding has been used to represent features as a feature matrix for DL models. To evaluate the performance of the OPCNN-FAKE, accuracy, precision, recall, F1-measure were applied to validate the results. The results show that OPCNN-FAKE model has achieved the best performance for each dataset compared with other models. Furthermore, the OPCNN-FAKE has a higher performance of cross-validation results and testing results over the other models, which indicates that the OPCNN-FAKE for fake news detection is significantly better than the other models.},

This work proposed to employ the dimensionality reduction techniques to reduce the dimensionality of the feature vectors before passing them to the classifier. To develop the reasoning, this work acquired a dataset from the Fake News Challenges (FNC) website which has four types of stances: agree, disagree, discuss, and unrelated. The nonlinear features are fed to PCA and chi-square which provides more contextual features for fake news detection. The motivation of this research is to determine the relative stance of a news article towards its headline. The proposed model improves results by 4\% and 20\% in terms of \$Accuracy\$ and \$F1-score\$ . The experimental results show that PCA outperforms than Chi-square and state-of-the-art methods with 97.8\% accuracy.},

	abstract = {With the rapid development of deep learning, many deep learning models have been widely used in Natural Language Processing(NLP). The Long-Short Term memory network(LSTM) model and convolutional neural network(CNN) model can achieve high classification accuracy in text classification tasks. However, the high input dimension of text features and the need to train a large number of parameters in the deep learning model often take a lot of time. This paper uses Term Frequency-inverse Document Frequency(TF-IDF) to remove features with lower weights, extract key features in the text, extract the corresponding word vector through the Word2Vec model, and then input it into the CNN-LSTM model. We compared the model with CNN, LSTM, and LSTM-attention methods and found that the model can significantly reduce model parameters and training time in short and long text data sets. The model hardly loses accuracy in the long text, but the model will lose a certain amount of accuracy in short texts. This paper also proposes fusing original text features to make up for the accuracy loss caused by the TF-IDF feature extraction method.},

Since English is the most dominant language in the world, hoax analyzers are mostly made to cater to news done in English. This study presents various Deep Neural Network (DNN) models: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Bidirectional LSTM (BI-LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), Bidirectional GRU (BI-GRU), and 1-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN) as well as two classifiers: Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Naïve Bayes used to predict the validity of news done in Bahasa Indonesia. The results show that DNN models are superior to classifiers in supervised text classification tasks, with 1D-CNN achieving the best result.},
